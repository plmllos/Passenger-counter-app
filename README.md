# Passenger-counter-app
JavaScript exercise from Scrimba

Original exercise is only with "increment" and "save" buttons together with JS functionality that goes along with those features. 
I added "decrement" and "reset" buttuns with functionality to make the app more functional. 

The UI shows the Increment button as the only enabled option to use. I am planning to add toggle feature for the buttons, 
so when the counter will increment to 1 the other buttons will be enabled. It's only about visual CSS, functionality already works in JS.

Maybe will also add the "Total" button to simultaneously summarize the amount from previous entries.
